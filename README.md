# CompuWrist Menu System
This project is to build a menu system for a Linux-based interface for a CompuWrist Computer.

## TODO
* Make it use a form of exec for item action commands rather than the "system" command, that clearly isn't reliable (and has to wait for a response too).
* Some kind of digital clock?
