# CompuWrist Menu System
This project is to build a menu system for a Linux-based interface for a CompuWrist Computer.

## Current Progress
This is basically how the menus look so far (in TinyCore Linux - Debian will have a different title-bar):

## TODO
- [X] Make it use a form of exec for item action commands rather than the "system" command, that clearly isn't reliable (and has to wait for a response too).
- [ ] Some kind of digital clock?
